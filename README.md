# -Library-Management-System
Library Management System version-1.0 made on zorin-16 using g++ compilier with file implementation 

if you wanna use it download the .cpp file and compile it in a c++ compilier. I used the g++ compilier and it worked hope it works or you too.
The dat file will be created once you run the file after compilation.
